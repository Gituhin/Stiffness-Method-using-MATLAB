# Stiffness-Method-using-MATLAB
This descripts a group project on structural analysis of a Frame using stiffness method in MATLAB
The .m file contains the MATLAB code for stiffness analysis.
The code is little structure specific but more or less contains the base to code for any possible structure.
Variables and number of nodes may change depending upon loading conditions imposed.
